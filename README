Press <s-FX> to map an action to the FX key where X is one of 2,3,4 ..
This action can be
* run last command
* run make
* ....

Alternatively you can set an action which is run whenever you write a buffer:
SetActionOnBufWrite

This plugin can be reused by many IDE like plugins (eg my vim-addon-fcsh does so)

I got two bad ratings. Would you consider sending me a note why you think it's that bad?
